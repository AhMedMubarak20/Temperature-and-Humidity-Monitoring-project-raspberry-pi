# Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitoring-project-raspberry-pi
Creating a temperature and humidity monitoring project using a Raspberry Pi can be a fun and practical DIY project. In this project, we'll use a DHT11 or DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity, and we'll write a Python script to display and log this data.
